"A certificate authority (CA) is an entity that signs digital certificates. Many websites need to \
let their customers know that the connection is secure, so they pay an internationally trusted CA \
(eg, VeriSign, DigiCert) to sign a certificate for their domain.\
"
echo \
"In some cases it may make more sense to act as your own CA, rather than paying a CA like DigiCert. \
Common cases include securing an intranet website, or for issuing certificates to clients to allow \
them to authenticate to a server (eg, Apache, OpenVPN).\
"
echo \
"Acting as a certificate authority (CA) means dealing with cryptographic pairs of private keys and \
public certificates. The very first cryptographic pair weâ€™ll create is the root pair. This consists \
of the root key (ca.key.pem) and root certificate (ca.cert.pem). This pair forms the identity of your CA.\
"
echo \
"Typically, the root CA does not sign server or client certificates directly. The root CA is only ever \
used to create one or more intermediate CAs, which are trusted by the root CA to sign certificates on \
their behalf. This is best practice. It allows the root key to be kept offline and unused as much as \
possible, as any compromise of the root key is disastrous.\
